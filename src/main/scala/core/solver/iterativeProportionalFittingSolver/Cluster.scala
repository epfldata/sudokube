/**
 * A Cluster, i.e., given knowledge of marginal distribution of a subset of variables.
 * @author Zhekai Jiang
 * @param variables The indices (in the original solver) of the variables concerned, encoded as bits of 1 in an Int.
 * @param distribution The marginal distribution of the variables. Values are encoded as bits of 1 in the index.
 *                     Indices are now with respect to the marginal variables, not all variables in the original solver.
 *                     e.g. given marginal variables 3, 11, and 16, they will have indices 0, 1, and 2 for the marginal distribution.
