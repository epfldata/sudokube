   * in a decreasing order (since we would prefer low-entropy ones).
   * At each time, the method will simply throw out the cluster with the lowest "normalized" entropy
   * but will skip a cluster if it contains at least one variable that is not covered by other remaining clusters.
   * The dropout will stop when either
   * (1) the normalized entropy is below 0.7 (based on empirical results), or
   * (2) the remaining "coverage", defined as the sum of the number of variables among all clusters, drops below |Q| * (|Q| - 1)
   *     - this threshold can be adjusted â€” right now the rationale simply comes from the fact that
   *       if we have all possible (|Q|-1)-dimensional cuboids, this "coverage" will be (|Q|-1) * C(|Q|, |Q|-1) = |Q| * (|Q|-1)
