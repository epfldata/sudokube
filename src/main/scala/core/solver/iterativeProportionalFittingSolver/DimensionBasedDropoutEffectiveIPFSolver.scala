   * The dropout will stop when
   * (1) 95% of the clusters have already been dropped,
   * (2) we have reached the maximum dimensionality of the fetched cuboids (i.e. we will keep all cuboids at the maximum dimensionality),
   * (3) the remaining "coverage", defined as the sum of the number of variables among all clusters, drops below |Q| * (|Q| - 1)
   *     - this threshold can be adjusted â€” right now the rationale simply comes from the fact that
   *       if we have all possible (|Q|-1)-dimensional cuboids, this "coverage" will be (|Q|-1) * C(|Q|, |Q|-1) = |Q| * (|Q|-1)
